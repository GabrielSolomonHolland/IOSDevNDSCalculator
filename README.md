# IOSDevNDSCalculator

This is the counterpart to the Android Dev NDS Calculator

This is being built for my IOS Developement class. My older brother is a carpenter and structural engineer who works with sheer diagrams and the NDS calculations. His work includes going through a physical pieces of paper to get data and calculations. This app is the IOS counterpart to the solution for him
